Hi, I’m Patricio Núñez Soto. 👋

I’m a passionate Computer Engineer 💻 with over 14 years of hands-on experience in systems, networks, tech support, automation, development, and cybersecurity. 🔧🛡️

I love diving into full stack development, homelab projects, home and building automation, and contributing to open source. 🚀 I approach my work fueled by curiosity and a bit of controlled chaos. ⚡️🤓

By nature, I’m an outlier—I don’t just accept things as they are. I ask questions, challenge the norm, and redesign processes—not to break things, but to understand and build better solutions. 🔍⚙️✨

Right now, I’m exploring:
• Decentralized infrastructure and crypto mining ⛓️💰
• Advanced home automation 🏠🤖
• Risk dashboards and clean, simple technical interfaces 📊🖥️
• Learning through video games and simulations 🎮🧠

I’m a Linux enthusiast 🐧, Git user 🔧, and a tech humanist. Based in Chile 🇨🇱 but ready to work wherever I’m needed. 🌎

Feel free to check out my work on GitHub! 🔗✨
