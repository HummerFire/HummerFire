Hi, I'm Patricio Núñez Soto

🚀 Computer Engineer with 14+ years of experience in systems, networking, tech support, automation, development, and cybersecurity.

💻 Passionate about full-stack development, homelab solutions, home/building automation, and open source projects. I work from curiosity and controlled chaos.

🧠 Natural outlier: I don’t settle for what’s given. I question, redesign, disrupt… not to break, but to understand and build better.

🛠️ Currently exploring:

    Decentralized infrastructure & crypto mining

    Advanced home automation

    Risk dashboards & simple technical interfaces

    Stealth education through games and simulations

🐧 Linux fan. Git lover. Technical humanist.
📍 From Chile, to wherever needed.
