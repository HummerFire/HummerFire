Hi, I'm Patricio Núñez Soto

🚀 Computer Engineer with 14+ years of experience in systems, networking, tech support, automation, development, and cybersecurity.

💻 Passionate about full-stack development, homelab solutions, home/building automation, and open source projects. 

🧠 Natural outlier: I don’t settle for what’s given. I question, redesign, disrupt… not to break, but to understand and build better.

🛠️ Currently exploring:

    Decentralized infrastructure & crypto mining

    Advanced home automation

    Risk dashboards & simple technical interfaces

    Stealth education through games and simulations

🐧 Linux fan. Git lover. Technical humanist.
📍 From Chile, to wherever needed.

    Systems don't evolve because of those who obey them, but because of those who challenge them. An outlier, far from being a threat, is a seed. Of disruption, yes. But also of redesign. Of improvement. Of resilience. And perhaps, of awareness.
